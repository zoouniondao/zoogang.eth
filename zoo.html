  <h2>Virtual Zoo Experience</h2>
  <p>We are excited to announce our plan to build one of the first virtual zoo experiences within an open public metaverse using Sandbox Game. Our goal is to create an immersive and educational experience for visitors that showcases a variety of animal species from around the world. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can offer unique and valuable experiences to our visitors, such as the ability to interact with and even own virtual representations of the animals.</p>

  <h2>Game Maker Fund Application</h2>
  <p>We have submitted an application to the Game Maker Fund in order to secure funding for our project. The Game Maker Fund is a grant program that supports independent game developers and projects that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe that our virtual zoo experience aligns with the mission of the Game Maker Fund and has the potential to be a game-changing project in the world of blockchain gaming.</p>
